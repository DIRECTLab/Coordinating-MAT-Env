This repository contains the codebase for our research on coordinating search operations using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and foundation models in complex, unstructured environments.

## Overview

Our system simulates a fleet of heterogeneous robots designed for search operations in challenging outdoor scenarios. The approach combines reinforcement learning (RL) and a centralized Multi-Agent Transformer (MAT) to coordinate autonomous agents, integrating sensory data into a structured knowledge graph for efficient decision-making.

### Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning**: Autonomous coordination among diverse robots using MARL.
- **Multi-Agent Transformer (MAT)**: Centralized decision-making model for high-level command interpretation.
- **Simulation Environment**: Developed with NVIDIA Isaac Sim and GRUtopia for high-fidelity and scalable robot simulations.


## Installation

CODE <COMING SOON>

## Usage

COMING SOON!

## Complex Environments

We evaluate our approach in complex, unstructured environments to test the system's robustness and scalability. The environments include:


* Rock fields (Nvidia Blast)
  
  A giude on how to create and use a destructible Environments with Blast is available [here](Docs/set_up_blast.md)

  ![Blast](Docs/assets/blast/blast.gif)

* Forest (Nvidia optimized vegetation assets)

  You can download a forest environment [here](https://usu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/a02233404_aggies_usu_edu/EiaLwVKnKUJIhuea4IRn7G8BSAsc93-9ItGP3WBFFrigmw?e=0rFzQC)

  ![Forest](Docs/assets/envs/tile_forest1.png)
  
* Night and Day Lighting (Nvidia Sun Study)

These environments are open-source and available for download SOON
