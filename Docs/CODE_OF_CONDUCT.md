# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone, regardless of their background, identity, or experience level. As contributors and maintainers of this project, we pledge to respect all individuals who participate, including by providing a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Providing constructive feedback and gracefully accepting feedback from others.
- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Showing empathy and respect towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
- Any other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing the project or community include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project team at [Christopher Dot Allred At USU Dot EDU]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

1. **Warning**: A private, written warning to the individual(s) involved, providing clarity on which behavior was deemed inappropriate and an outline of expected changes.
   
2. **Temporary Ban**: A temporary ban from interactions or contributions, enforced after repeated or severe violations of the standards.

3. **Permanent Ban**: A permanent ban from any sort of interaction or public communication within the community, typically following a pattern of repeated violations or severe incidents.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1, available at [https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html).
